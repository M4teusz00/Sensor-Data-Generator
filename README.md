# Sensor-Data-Generator
A simple project generating data (Big Data) from weather sensors into a MongoDB database. They can be used for further analysis.

# Connect to your MongoDB and Generate the Data
Firstly, you need to connect to MongoDB instance and create the database + collection. Then you can simply run the code from the files "Publisher1", ..., "Publisher3". Remember, you have to run this in 3 different terminals to generate the data in the same time.

# Data in the MongoDB
In repository there is a .ipynb file (Yupyter Notebook) which can be used to the analysis of generated data. It simply uses the MongoDB as a data source.
